## Test L4: Cloud Deployment, CI/CD, and Infrastructure as Code

### Objective

Extend the previous task by deploying the API application to a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure) using container orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). You will demonstrate your ability to implement modern deployment practices, ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficiency.

### Task Overview

You will deploy the API application you developed in the previous task to a cloud environment. This task includes setting up a microservices architecture, implementing container orchestration, establishing a CI/CD pipeline, and using IaC tools to manage cloud resources. Additionally, you will integrate DNS, managed databases, and advanced monitoring tools.

### Requirements

1. **Environment**: Choose one cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure) for deployment.
2. **Container Orchestration**: Use Kubernetes, AWS ECS, or GCP Cloud Run for managing containers.
3. **CI/CD**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using cloud-native tools or popular CI/CD platforms (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
4. **IaC Tools**: Use Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, or Azure Resource Manager for infrastructure management.
5. **Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation for the deployment process, including setup instructions and architecture diagrams.

  - **Managed Databases**: Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB.
  - **DNS**: Azure DNS.
  - **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor, Prometheus/Grafana.
  - **IaC**: Terraform, Azure Resource Manager Templates.

#### 2. Microservices Architecture

- **Decouple Services**:
  - Design your application to follow a microservices architecture, splitting it into distinct services (e.g., authentication, data processing, API gateway).
  - Ensure each service is independently deployable and scalable.

- **Service Communication**:
  - Implement service-to-service communication using RESTful APIs or message queues (e.g., Amazon SQS, Google Pub/Sub, Azure Service Bus).

#### 3. Container Orchestration

- **Kubernetes/ECS/Cloud Run**:
  - Deploy your containerized application using Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS) or other orchestration services (ECS, Cloud Run).
  - Configure scaling policies, health checks, and load balancing to ensure reliability and performance.

- **Configuration Management**:
  - Use tools like Helm for Kubernetes to manage configurations and deployments.
  - Implement environment variables or secrets management for configuration (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault).

#### 4. CI/CD Pipeline

- **Automated Testing**:
  - Integrate automated testing into the CI/CD pipeline to validate code changes.
  - Ensure tests cover critical functionalities and edge cases.

- **Continuous Integration**:
  - Set up the CI pipeline to automatically build and test code changes.
  - Use Docker to build and publish container images to a container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry, Azure Container Registry).

- **Continuous Deployment**:
  - Implement the CD pipeline to automatically deploy changes to the staging and production environments.
  - Use blue-green deployment or canary deployment strategies to minimize downtime and risk.

#### 5. Monitoring and Logging

- **Monitoring**:
  - Set up monitoring for application performance and health using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring, or Azure Monitor.
  - Configure alerts for critical issues (e.g., service outages, high latency).

- **Logging**:
  - Implement centralized logging using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging, or Azure Monitor Logs.
  - Ensure logs are structured and searchable for troubleshooting.

#### 6. Managed Databases and DNS

- **Managed Databases**:
  - Use managed database services (e.g., Amazon RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database) to handle your database needs.
  - Ensure databases are configured for high availability and automated backups.

- **DNS**:
  - Set up DNS using cloud-native services (e.g., Amazon Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, Azure DNS) to manage domain names and routing.

#### 7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **Infrastructure Management**:
  - Use IaC tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, or Azure Resource Manager Templates to define and manage your cloud infrastructure.
  - Ensure infrastructure is version-controlled and easily reproducible.

- **Automation**:
  - Automate the provisioning and scaling of infrastructure resources.
  - Implement infrastructure changes through code to ensure consistency and reduce manual errors.

### Submission

Break the submission into smaller tasks for clarity and focus:

1. **Code Repository**:
   - Structure your project with separate directories for code, infrastructure, and documentation.
   - Include a `README.md` file with instructions for setting up, deploying, and running the application, including Dockerization and cloud deployment steps.

2. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Provide IaC scripts (Terraform files, CloudFormation templates, etc.) to automate the deployment of cloud resources.
   - Include detailed comments and documentation explaining the purpose and configuration of each resource.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Include configuration files and scripts for setting up the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Document the steps involved in the CI/CD process, including testing, building, and deployment.

4. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - Provide architecture diagrams illustrating the microservices setup and service interactions.
   - Document the design decisions and trade-offs involved in the microservices architecture.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
