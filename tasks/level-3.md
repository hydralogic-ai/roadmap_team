## Test L3: API Implementation with Popular Frameworks

### Objective

Extend Task 3 to implement RESTful APIs using various programming languages and frameworks. You will create APIs to interact with your database solutions, demonstrating your ability to design, implement, test, and document APIs according to modern best practices.

### Task Overview

You will implement a RESTful API for the database system you chose in Task 3. The API should support CRUD operations and provide endpoints for interacting with your database model. You will also develop test cases and documentation for the API.

### Requirements

1. **Environment**: Use any preferred development environment for the chosen language and framework.
2. **Documentation**: Include detailed API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.
3. **Testing**: Provide comprehensive test cases to validate API functionality and performance.
4. **Tools**: Use appropriate frameworks and libraries for API development, testing, and documentation.

### Supported Languages and Frameworks

Choose **one** language and its popular framework from the list below:

- **Python**:
  - FastAPI
  - Django REST Framework
  - Flask

- **JavaScript/Node.js**:
  - Express.js
  - NestJS

- **Java**:
  - Spring Boot

- **C#**:
  - ASP.NET Core

- **Go**:
  - Gin
  - Echo

- **Ruby**:
  - Ruby on Rails

- **Rust**:
  - Actix
  - Rocket

### Instructions

For the chosen language and framework, implement the following:

#### 1. API Implementation

- **CRUD Endpoints**:
  - **Create**: Implement endpoints to create new records in your database.
  - **Read**: Implement endpoints to retrieve records by ID and list all records.
  - **Update**: Implement endpoints to update existing records.
  - **Delete**: Implement endpoints to delete records by ID.

- **Advanced Features**:
  - Implement filtering, sorting, and pagination for list endpoints.
  - Provide endpoints for specific operations based on your database model (e.g., semantic search for vector databases).

#### 2. API Testing

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Develop unit tests for each API endpoint to ensure they function correctly.
  - Use testing frameworks specific to your chosen language (e.g., Pytest for Python, JUnit for Java, Mocha for Node.js).

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Implement integration tests to validate the interaction between the API and your database.
  - Ensure tests cover edge cases and error handling.

- **Load Testing**:
  - Conduct basic load testing to evaluate API performance under high traffic.

#### 3. API Documentation

- **Documentation Tools**:
  - Use Swagger/OpenAPI to generate comprehensive API documentation.
  - Ensure the documentation includes all endpoints, request/response examples, and error codes.

- **User Guide**:
  - Provide a brief user guide or README explaining how to set up and use the API.
  - Include examples of API requests and responses.

#### 4. Running the API and Dockerization

- **Running Locally**:
  - Provide instructions for setting up the development environment and running the API locally.
  - Include any necessary environment variables, configurations, and dependency installations.

- **Dockerization**:
  - Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the API application.
  - Ensure the Docker image includes all necessary dependencies and configurations.
  - Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage multi-container applications if needed (e.g., database and API).

- **Running with Docker**:
  - Provide instructions for building and running the Docker container.
  - Include steps for starting the application using Docker Compose if applicable.

### Submission

- **GitHub Repository**:
  - Structure your project clearly, organizing code, tests, and documentation.
  - Include a `README.md` file with instructions for setting up, running, and Dockerizing the API, including dependencies.
  - Ensure all code, tests, and documentation are clear and comprehensive.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following practical criteria:

- **API Design and Implementation**:
  - **Correctness**: Endpoints are implemented correctly and adhere to RESTful principles.
  - **Functionality**: API covers all required CRUD operations and additional features.

- **Testing and Validation**:
  - **Coverage**: Tests cover all endpoints and key functionalities.
  - **Robustness**: Tests handle edge cases and error conditions.

- **Documentation**:
  - **Clarity**: Documentation is clear, accurate, and provides sufficient detail.
  - **Usability**: API documentation is user-friendly, with examples and setup instructions.

- **Performance and Scalability**:
  - **Efficiency**: API handles concurrent requests and large datasets effectively.
  - **Optimization**: Load testing results demonstrate the API's ability to scale under pressure.

- **Code Organization and Readability**:
  - **Structure**: Code is well-organized and follows best practices for the chosen language and framework.
  - **Readability**: Code is clean, with meaningful naming and appropriate comments.

- **Dockerization**:
  - **Correctness**: Dockerfile and Docker Compose configurations are correct and functional.
  - **Usability**: Instructions for running the application with Docker are clear and effective.
