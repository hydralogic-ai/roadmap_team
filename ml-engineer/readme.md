  - Set up your development environment (install Python, IDE, Docker, Git).
  - Clone a repository from the company’s GitHub and run a basic script.
  - Review project documentation and create a summary report.

#### Week 3-4: Basic Tools and Data Handling
**Goals:** Understand and use company tools for data handling and preprocessing.
- **Week 3:**
  - **Task:** Set up a Docker container for a basic ML model and document the steps.
  - **Task:** Use AWS to create a simple S3 bucket and upload/download data.
- **Week 4:**
  - **Task:** Clean and preprocess a provided dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
  - **Task:** Implement feature engineering techniques and document your process.
- **Tasks:**
  - Deploy a simple model using the company’s framework and create a step-by-step guide.

#### Week 5-6: Model Training and Evaluation
**Goals:** Train and evaluate machine learning models with practical applications.
- **Week 5:**
  - **Task:** Train a simple regression model on a given dataset. Evaluate using RMSE.
  - **Task:** Document the training process and results in a report.
- **Week 6:**
  - **Task:** Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for the model.
  - **Task:** Compare the performance of different models and create a presentation.
- **Tasks:**
  - Complete a detailed report on model performance and tuning results.

#### Week 7-8: Advanced Model Development
**Goals:** Develop and optimize more complex models, including neural networks.
- **Week 7:**
  - **Task:** Build and train a simple neural network using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
  - **Task:** Evaluate the neural network's performance and document findings.
- **Week 8:**
  - **Task:** Implement a more advanced model (e.g., CNN for image classification or RNN for NLP tasks).
  - **Task:** Perform hyperparameter tuning on the advanced model.
- **Tasks:**
  - Complete a mini-project on an advanced ML topic relevant to the company.

#### Week 9-10: Model Deployment and Monitoring
**Goals:** Deploy models to production and set up monitoring.
- **Week 9:**
  - **Task:** Deploy a trained model using the company’s deployment pipeline (e.g., AWS SageMaker).
  - **Task:** Set up basic monitoring for the deployed model (e.g., using Prometheus and Grafana).
- **Week 10:**
  - **Task:** Implement automated testing for the deployed model to ensure reliability.
  - **Task:** Create a dashboard to visualize model performance metrics.
- **Tasks:**
  - Document the deployment and monitoring setup process.
  - Prepare a report on model performance in production.

#### Week 11-12: Capstone Project and Integration
**Goals:** Integrate into the team, complete a comprehensive project, and present findings.
- **Week 11:**
  - **Task:** Start a capstone project that integrates all learned skills (choose a project relevant to ongoing company needs).
  - **Task:** Collaborate with team members to get feedback and improve the project.
- **Week 12:**
  - **Task:** Finalize the capstone project, ensuring all aspects are documented and tested.
  - **Task:** Prepare a presentation and present the project to the team.
- **Tasks:**
  - Complete and submit the capstone project.
  - Present the project and participate in a Q&A session with the team.
